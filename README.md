# Prime-Factors
A Java Program to print the Prime Factors of a given number

Prime factorization also known as prime decomposition of a number is the determination of the set of prime numbers which mulitply together to give the original number. 

For example if 26 is the given number, the prime factors for it would be 2, 13 which are both prime and when mulitplied will result in the givne number.

The pseudo code for the program is as following.

- Find the number of times the given number is divisible by 2 and get the final reminder.
- The remainder from the above step should be an odd number if it is not zero, so starting with 3, find number of times the resultant is divisible by the odd numbers.
